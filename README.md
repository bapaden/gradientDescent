# Gradient Descent Method <br />
Gradient descent method for unconstrained minimization. The implementation uses finite differences to compute a gradient, and the Armijo step size rule to move in the steepest descent direction.<br /> 

# Example usage <br />
Using the CMakelists.txt to compile the project builds a simple use demo which minimizes a trivial quadratic function of the form: <br />
min f(x)=x'Ax<br />
